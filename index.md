## MEBOW
### Monocular Estimation of Body Orientation In the Wild
### Overview
Body orientation estimation provides crucial visual cues in many applications, including robotics and autonomous driving. It is particularly desirable when 3D pose estimation is difficult to infer due to poor image resolution, occlusion, or indistinguishable body parts. 

We present COCO-MEBOW (Monocular Estimation of Body Orientation in the Wild), a new large-scale dataset for orientation estimation from a single in-the-wild image. The body-orientation labels for 133380 human bodies within 55K images from the COCO dataset have been collected using an efficient and high-precision annotation pipeline. There are 127844 human instance in training set and 5536 human instance in validation set.

Based on MEBOW, we established a simple baseline model for human body orientation estimation. The code for baseline model will be available on [Github](https://github.com/ChenyanWu/MEBOW).
